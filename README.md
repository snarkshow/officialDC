is it weird if you justify the text?
can you make the Hennessy logo a tad smaller? it's totally swamping the other two in that line 
what weird thing is happening with the 'A' in Veja? 
line 3 of logos is misaligned. i know each line isn't the same but that one sticks out. 
are you going to link my Linkedin soon?
